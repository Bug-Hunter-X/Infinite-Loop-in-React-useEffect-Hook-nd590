This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: an infinite loop caused by a missing dependency array.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises because the `useEffect` hook runs after every render without specifying dependencies, leading to a continuous update cycle. The solution involves correctly specifying the `count` variable in the dependency array, ensuring the effect only runs when `count` changes.
